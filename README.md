# NYC-Taxi-Exploration
In this project, I try to explore the data of NYC taxi provided by http://www.nyc.gov/.
I build two models to predict the price and total trips in a given time period and area. The varibles I choose including pickup location, pickup time, number of passengers and weather.

# How things work
In the 'Data_clean.ipynb', I cleaned up the data. I imported the green and yellow taxi data of Feb, 2016 and divied different pickup time to 5 different periods(dawn, morning rush, afternoon, nightrush and midnight), divied pickup locations to 9 different arears. The division of areas was based on the work done by DANIEL FORSYTH, MAPPING NYC TAXI DATA(http://www.danielforsyth.me/mapping-nyc-taxi-data/)
